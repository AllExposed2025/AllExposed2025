    <h1>All Exposed</h1>
    <h2>$XPOS — The Blackpaper</h2>

    <p><strong>All Exposed</strong> is not just a token. It is a <em>movement</em>. A rebellion against the crypto elite, a direct assault on the fabricated empires of hype and deception. While they orchestrate scams in backrooms and manipulate markets for personal gain, we stand for one thing: <em>total exposure</em>.</p>

    <p>$XPOS is forged in response to corruption. Born in darkness, not to hide—but to reveal. We shine a fluorescent light on lies, greed, and manipulation. No founders hiding behind multisigs. No fake promises. Just truth, code, and community.</p>

    <p>This project is anonymous, permanent, and irreversible. We do not ask for trust—we verify. Every wallet, every transfer, every lie exposed. This is crypto as it was meant to be: <em>transparent and unforgiving</em>.</p>

    <h2>Tokenomics</h2>
    <p>
        Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 $XPOS<br>
        • 50% Liquidity<br>
        • 25% Community Airdrops<br>
        • 15% Black Ops Treasury<br>
        • 10% Core Team (locked 6 months)<br>
        • Contract address: <em>To Be Announced</em>
    </p>

    <h2>Why $XPOS?</h2>
    <p>Because someone had to do it. $XPOS isn’t here to play by their rules. It’s here to <strong>burn their playbook</strong>. We believe in radical transparency and meme-powered reckoning. If you're reading this, you're already part of the resistance.</p>
